=== GeoPackage Results

==== Raster and vector files in one file

The initiative tested the capability of including both raster and vector data in one file. One file size was 5 GB which included high resolution data.

==== Sort Attributes in SQLite schema
Sort attributes alphabetically in the SQLite schema. If not, it is hard to find attributes in user interfaces to select features to filter.

==== Remove local links
If GeoPackage files contain links to data producer local file system, some data (e.g styles) might not be accessible.

==== Investigate further GDAL Validation issues

Several GDAL validation issues were reported that require further investigation with GDAL developers:

==== Investigate further GeoPackage performance
Some files >600 MB were slower to load. Need to investigate further the raw causes of such behavior.

Two files in Sprint 1 with raster data were 1 GB and 5 GB. Raster queries were easy to perform.

==== Investigate further transparency
Some clients reported apparent transparency in raster layers.

==== GeoPackage convenience packaging both raster and vector data

One participant provided a GeoPackage file containing both raster and vector data. Various clients were able to open the file. The GeoPackage contained high resolution satellite images and elevation data in the 2D gridded coverage extension schema. Tile-based, pyramidal, floating-point raster data is a distinguishing feature of GeoPackage.
